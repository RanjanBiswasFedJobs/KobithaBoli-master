<h2>History of Rome</h2>
<p>There is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from at
least 14,000 years, but the dense layer of much younger debris obscures
Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites.[11] Evidence of stone tools, pottery and
stone weapons attest to at least 10,000 years of human presence.

<h2>Government of Rome</h2>
<p>Rome constitutes one of Italy's 8,101 communes, and is the largest both in terms
of land area and population. It is governed by a mayor, currently Gianni Alemanno,
and a city council.
